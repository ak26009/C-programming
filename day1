first code in C

Variables
1 variable is a container in C which we used to store some data .
2 variables are case sensitive, there should not be any blank place in between the variables , underscore is valid , Special symbols are no valid 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10; variable declaration 
    int b=20;
    int sum = a+b;
    
    printf("The op of this program is %d", sum);       here the %d is used for the v 

    return 0;
}

op The op of this program is 30

DATA TYPES

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int a;
    a = 10;
    
    float b ;
    b = 1.4;
    
    char c;
    c = 'A';
    
    printf();

    return 0;
}



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int a;
    a = 10;
    
    float b ;
    b = 1.4;
    
    char c;
    c = 'A';
    
    printf("The value of integer a is %d\n ", a );
    printf("The value of integer b is %f\n ", b );
    printf("The value of integer c is %c\n ", c );

    return 0;
}

op - The value of integer a is 10
 The value of integer b is 1.400000
 The value of integer c is A
