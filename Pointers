BASIC CODE OF POINTERS 

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int i = 12;
    int* j = &i;  // here j is storing the address of i
    printf("The address of i is %p\n",j);
    printf("The address of i is %p\n",&i);
    
    printf("The value at address i is  %d\n", *(&i)); // HERE WE GET THE VALUE OF I THAT IS 12 
    return 0 ;
}




SOME BASIC OF POINTERS 

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int i = 8;
    int *j ;
    j = &i; 
    
    printf("add i = %u\n",&i); // this shows the address of i 
    printf("add i = %u\n",j); // this shows the adress of i as j = &i
    printf("add j = %u\n",&j); //this shows the address of j
    
    printf("value i = %d\n",i); // this shows the value inside the i  
    printf("value i = %d\n",*(&i)); // this shows the value inside the i 
    printf("value i = %d\n",*j);// this shows the value inside the i  as j = &i
    
    return 0 ;
